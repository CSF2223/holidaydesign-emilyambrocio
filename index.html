            Guatemalans get fired up for Christmas. Literally. December 6 marks La Quema del Diablo (“the Burning of the Devil”), which is when families
            in Guatemala set bonfires outside of their homes and burn effigies of Satan to expunge evil spirits, celebrating the victory of good over evil.
            In the past, people would bring out all the trash from their houses and set it alight, and some still do. In the wake of environmental backlash,
            however, many people stick to burning piñatas shaped like the Devil. This celebration is accompanied by traditional donuts and warm fruit punch,
            and it signifies the start of the Christmas season.</p>
