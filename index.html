        <p>When you’re talking about December holidays, you can’t forget Christmas.
            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious
            and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year,
            it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically
            in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,
            is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the
            holiday season organized around it.
            The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
            in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable
            where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.

            Enormously popular in many places, Christmas involves a host of different traditions in the many countries where it’s celebrated. For example:
            In Mexico, the celebration of Las Posadas from December 16 to December 24 honors Mary and Joseph’s search for an inn.
            Every night, families go to a different home and ask for shelter. Once they’re let in, they celebrate together!
            In India, people attend special midnight masses and make kheer, a sweet pudding, for neighbors and family.
            Norwegians celebrate with their own kind of rice pudding, called riskrem, on Christmas Eve.
            Brazilian children leave a sock near the window for Bom Velhinho (a Brazilian name for Santa Claus). If he finds it, they get a present!
            In Ireland, some people take a cold swim in the ocean on Christmas morning!</p>

            Guatemalans get fired up for Christmas. Literally. December 6 marks La Quema del Diablo (“the Burning of the Devil”), which is when families
            in Guatemala set bonfires outside of their homes and burn effigies of Satan to expunge evil spirits, celebrating the victory of good over evil.
            In the past, people would bring out all the trash from their houses and set it alight, and some still do. In the wake of environmental backlash,
            however, many people stick to burning piñatas shaped like the Devil. This celebration is accompanied by traditional donuts and warm fruit punch,
            and it signifies the start of the Christmas season.</p>
